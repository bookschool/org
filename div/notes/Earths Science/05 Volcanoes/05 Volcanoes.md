The **crust** is Earth's rocky, outer layer.

A **plate** is one of the large pieces that Earth's crust is broken into.

**Boundaries** are lines along which something ends.

**Complete the tasks below.**

1. Mr. Carenni said, "For today's activity, let's make a model of Earth's crust.
We can think of the crust as a thin film of ice resting on top of a much thicker
layer of hard, packed snow. Now let's suppose that the ice breaks into pieces.
On Earth, these pieces are called plates. The edges of the plates are called
boundaries." Suppose two pieces of ice are pushed slowly together. What might
happen to the edges of the pieces?

### Volcanoes and Plate Tectonics
- Where Are Volcanoes Found on Earth's Surface?

**Complete the tasks below.**

1. Mountain of Fire, Mountain of Ice Climbers who struggle up the snow-packed
slopes of Mount Erebus on Antarctica may be in for an unpleasant surprise. Balls
of scorching molten rock three meters across might come hurtling out of the air
and land just steps from climbers' feet! Why? Because Mount Erebus is one of
Earth's southernmost volcanoes. Scientists believe that Mount Erebus lies over
an area where material from Earth's mantle rises and then melts. The melted
material reaches the surface at Mount Erebus. How did Mount Erebus form?


### Where Are Volcanoes Found on Earth's Surface?

The eruption of a volcano can be awe-inspiring. Molten material can be spewed
high into the atmosphere. Villages can be buried in volcanic ash. A **volcano** is a
mountain that forms in Earth's crust when molten material, or magma, reaches the
surface. **Magma** is molten mixture of rock-forming substances, gases, and water
from the mantle. When magma reaches the surface, it is called **lava**. After magma
and lava cool, they form solid rock.

### Volcanoes and Plate Boundaries 
Are volcanoes found randomly across Earth? No, in
general, volcanoes form a regular pattern on Earth. To understand why, look at
the map in Figure 1. Notice how volcanoes occur in many great, long belts. EiM
**Volcanic belts form along the boundaries of Earth's plates.**

Volcanoes can occur where two plates pull apart, or diverge. Here, plate
movements cause the crust to fracture. The fractures in the crust allow magma to
reach the surface. Volcanoes can also occur where two plates push together, or
converge. As the plates push together, one plate can sink beneath the other
plate. Water that is brought down with the sinking plate eventually helps to
form magma, which rises to the surface.

The **Ring of Fire**, shown in Figure 1, is one major belt of volcanoes. It includes
the many volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire includes the
volcanoes along the coasts of North and South America and those in Japan and the
Philippines.

    <img src="fig01.png" alt="Figure 1"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 1. Ring of Fire.</figcaption>
  </figure>



### Diverging Boundaries 

Volcanoes form along the mid-ocean ridges, where two plates move apart.
Mid-ocean ridges form long, underwater mountain ranges that sometimes have a
rift valley down their center. Along the rift valley, lava pours out of cracks
in the ocean floor. This process gradually builds new mountains. Volcanoes also
form along diverging plate boundaries on land. For example, large volcanoes are
found along the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.

### Converging Boundaries 
Many volcanoes form near converging plate boundaries, where two oceanic plates
collide. Through subduction, the older, denser plate sinks into the mantle and
creates a deep-ocean trench. Water in the sinking plate eventually leaves the
crust and rises into the wedge of the mantle above it. As a result, the melting
point of the mantle in the wedge is lowered. So, the mantle partially melts. The
magma that forms as a result rises up. This magma can break through the ocean
floor, creating volcanoes.

The resulting volcanoes sometime create a string of islands called an **island
arc**. Look at Figure 2. The curve of an island arc echoes the curve of its
deep-ocean trench. Major island arcs include Japan, New Zealand, the Aleutians,
and the Caribbean islands.

  <figure>
    <img src="fig02.png" alt="Figure 2"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 2. Volcanoes and Converging Boundaries.</figcaption>
  </figure>

Volcanoes also occur where an oceanic plate is subducted beneath a continental
plate. Collisions of this type produced the volcanoes of the Andes Mountains in
South America. In the United States, plate collisions also produced the
volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest, including Mount St. Helens and Mount
Rainier.


### Hot Spots 

Not all volcanoes form along plate boundaries. Some volcanoes are the result of
"hot spots" in Earth's mantle. A **hot spot** is an area where material from deep
within Earth's mantle rises through the crust and melts to form magma.

**A volcano forms above a hot spot when magma erupts through the crust and reaches
the surface.** Hot spots stay in one place for many millions of years while the
plate moves over them. Some hot spot volcanoes lie close to plate boundaries.
Others lie in the middle of plates. Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming marks a
huge hot spot under the North American plate.





**Complete the tasks below.**

1. The Ring of Fire, see Figure 1. The Ring of Fire is a belt of volcanoes that
circles the Pacific Ocean. As with most of Earth's volcanoes, these volcanoes
form along boundaries of tectonic plates. Circle a volcano on the map that does
not fall along a plate boundary. Why did this volcano form here? 

2. Volcanoes often form belts along plate boundaries. How does Figure 1
illustrate that this statement holds true for North America?

### Volcanic Eruptions
- What Happens When a Volcano Erupts? 
- What Are the Stages of Volcanic Activity?


**Complete the tasks below.**

1. Can lava look like hair from the top of your head? It often does in Hawaii!
Here, hikers may come across thin strands of hardened material that shimmer like
gold in the sunlight. These thin strands are Pele's hair. Pele is the Hawaiian
goddess of volcanoes and fire. Her "hair" is actually volcanic glass! It forms
when tiny drops of molten lava fly into the air. The wind stretches these drops
into threads that are as thin as hair. The glass strands then settle in crevices
in the ground, forming clumps. How does Pele's hair form?

### What Happens When a Volcano Erupts?

Lava begins as magma. Magma usually forms in the somewhat soft layer of hot,
solid rock that lies in the upper mantle, just below a layer of harder rock. The
magma is less dense than the material that is around it. So it rises into any
cracks in the rock above. If this magma reaches the surface, a volcano can form.

### Inside a Volcano 

  <figure>
    <img src="fig04.png" alt="Figure 4"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 4. Inside a Volcano.</figcaption>
  </figure>

A volcano is more than a large, cone-shaped mountain. Inside a volcano is a
system of passageways through which magma moves, as shown in Figure 4.
- **Magma chamber** All volcanoes have a pocket of magma beneath the surface.
Beneath a volcano, magma collects in a magma chamber. During an eruption, the
magma forces its way through one or more cracks in Earth's crust.
- **Pipe** Magma moves upward through a pipe, a long tube that extends from Earth's
crust up through the top of the volcano, connecting the magma chamber to Earth's
surface.
- **Vent** Molten rock and gas leave the volcano through an opening called a
vent. Some volcanoes have a single central vent at the top. But volcanoes often
have vents on the sides also.
- **Lava** flow A lava flow is the spread of lava as it pours out of a vent.
- **Crater** A crater is a bowl-shaped area that may form at the top of a volcano
around the central vent.


### A Volcanic Eruption 

Perhaps you know that dissolved carbon dioxide gas is trapped in every can of
soda. But did you know that dissolved gases are trapped in magma? These
dissolved gases are under great pressure. During an eruption, as magma rises
toward the surface, the pressure of the surrounding rock on the magma decreases.
The dissolved gases begin to expand, forming bubbles. These bubbles are much
like the bubbles in the soda can. As pressure falls within the magma, the size
of the gas bubbles increases greatly. These expanding gases exert great force. 
**When a volcano erupts, the force of the expanding gases pushes magma from the
magma chamber through the pipe until it flows or explodes out of the vent.** Once
magma escapes from the volcano and becomes lava, the remaining gases bubble out.

### Two Types of Volcanic Eruptions 

Some volcanic eruptions occur gradually, over days, months, or even years.
Others are great explosions. **Geologists classify volcanic eruptions as quiet
or explosive.** Whether an eruption is quiet or explosive depends in part on the
magma's silica content and whether the magma is thin and runny or thick and
sticky. **Silica** is a material found in magma that forms from the elements oxygen
and silicon. Temperature also helps determine how fluid, or runny, magma is.

  <figure>
    <img src="fig05.png" alt="Figure 5"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 5. Types of Magma.</figcaption>
  </figure>


### Quiet Eruptions 

A volcano erupts quietly if its magma is hot or low in silica. Hot, low-silica
magma is thin and runny and flows easily. The gases in the magma bubble out
gently. Low-silica lava oozes quietly from the vent and can flow for many
kilometers.

Quiet eruptions can produce different types of lava, as shown in Figure 6. The
different types of lava harden into different types of rock. Pahoehoe forms from
fast-moving, hot lava that is thin and runny. The surface of pahoehoe looks like
a solid mass of ropelike coils. Aa forms from lava that is cooler and thicker.
The lava that aa forms from is also slower-moving. Aa has a rough surface
consisting of jagged lava chunks.

  <figure>
    <img src="fig06.png" alt="Figure 6"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 6. Lava From Quiet Eruptions.</figcaption>
  </figure>

Mostly quiet eruptions formed the Hawaiian Islands. On the island of Hawaii,
lava pours from the crater near the top of Kilauea. Lava also flows out of long
cracks on the volcano's sides. In general, the temperature of magma and lava can
range from about 750°C to I175°C—hot enough to melt copper! Quiet eruptions have
built up the island of Hawaii over hundreds of thousands of years.

### Explosive Eruptions 

A volcano erupts explosively if its magma is high in silica. High-silica magma
is thick and sticky. This type of magma can build up in the volcano's pipe,
plugging it like a cork in a bottle. Dissolved gases, including water vapor,
cannot escape from the thick magma. The trapped gases build up pressure until
they explode. The erupting gases and steam push the magma out of the volcano
with incredible force. That's what happened during the eruption of Mount St.
Helens in Washington State. This eruption is shown in Figure 7.

  <figure>
    <img src="fig07.png" alt="Figure 7"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 7. Mount St. Helens.</figcaption>
  </figure>

An explosive eruption throws lava powerfully into the air where it breaks into
fragments that quickly cool and harden into pieces of different sizes. The
smallest pieces are volcanic ash. Volcanic ash is made up of fine, rocky
particles as small as a speck of dust. Pebble-sized particles are called
cinders. Larger pieces, called bombs, may range from the size of a golf ball to
the size of a car.

### Volcano Hazards 
Both quiet eruptions and explosive eruptions can cause damage far from a
crater's rim. For example, during a quiet eruption, lava flows from vents,
setting fire to, and often burying, everything in its path. A quiet eruption can
cover large areas with a thick layer of lava.

During an explosive eruption, a volcano can belch out a mixture of dangerous
materials such as hot rock and ash. This mixture of materials can form a
fast-moving cloud that rushes down the sides of the volcano. A **pyroclastic
flow** is the mixture of hot gases, ash, cinders, and bombs that flow down the
sides of a volcano when it erupts explosively. Landslides of mud, melted snow,
and rock can also form from an explosive eruption. Figure 8 shows one result of
an explosive eruption.


  <figure>
    <img src="fig08.png" alt="Figure 8"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 8. Mount Pinatubo Eruption 1991</figcaption>
  </figure>


### What Are the Stages of Volcanic Activity?

The activity of a volcano may last from less than a decade to more than 10
million years. But most long-lived volcanoes do not erupt continuously. You can
see the pattern of activity by looking at the eruptions of volcanoes in the
Cascade Range, shown in Figure 9. Mount Jefferson has not erupted in at least
15,000 years. Will it ever erupt again? **Geologists often use the terms
active, dormant, or extinct to describe a volcano's stage of activity.**

An active, or live, volcano is one that is erupting or has shown signs that it
may erupt in the near future. A **dormant**, or sleeping, volcano is a volcano that
scientists expect to awaken in the future and become active. An **extinct**, or
dead, volcano is a volcano that is unlikely to ever erupt again. For example,
hot-spot volcanoes may become extinct after they drift away from the hot spot.

Changes in activity in and around a volcano may give warning shortly before a
volcano erupts. Geologists use special instruments to detect these changes. For
example, tiltmeters can detect slight surface changes in elevation and tilt
caused by magma moving underground. Geologists can also monitor gases escaping
from the volcano. They monitor the many small earthquakes that occur around a
volcano before an eruption. The upward movement of magma triggers these
earthquakes. Also, rising temperatures in underground water may signal that
magma is nearing the surface.

### Volcanic Landforms

- What Landforms Do Lava and Ash Create? 
- What Landforms Does Magma Create?

**Complete the tasks below.**

1. Jackson: I was subjected to the sight of an active, dangerous volcano. We
were on Hawaii, in a small aircraft over the Big Island. The volcano was quite
large—maybe a few miles in diameter. Out of the top of this volcano, there was
an immense pillar of smoke, being blown out to sea by the Hawaiian winds.
Judging by the patterns of the hardened lava on the slopes of the volcano, it
was a shield volcano. The whole area was literally oozing with volcanic
activity. Quite a few large depressions had formed where presumably there had
been a magma pocket that collapsed in on itself.
a) What landforms were created by the volcano that Jackson saw?
b) If you had a chance to visit Hawaii, would you prefer to see a volcano from
an airplane or from the ground? Explain.

### What Landforms Do Lava and Ash Create?

Lava has built up much of the islands of Hawaii. In fact, for much of Earth's
history, volcanic activity on and beneath Earth's surface has built up Earth's
land areas and formed much of the ocean crust. **Volcanic eruptions create
landforms made of lava, ash, and other materials. These landforms include shield
volcanoes, cinder cone volcanoes, composite volcanoes, and lava plateaus. Other
landforms include calderas, which are the huge holes left by the collapse of
volcanoes.** A caldera is shown in Figure 11.

### Calderas

Large eruptions can empty the main vent and magma chamber beneath a volcano.
With nothing to support it, the mountain top may collapse inward. A **caldera** is
the hole left when a volcano collapses. A lake can form, filling the hole. If
the volcano erupts again, a steep-walled cone may form in the middle.


  <figure>
    <img src="fig11.png" alt="Figure 11"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 11. Calderas.</figcaption>
  </figure>


### Cinder Cone Volcanoes
If a volcano's magma has high silica content, it will be thick and sticky. So
the volcano can erupt explosively, producing ash, cinders, and bombs. These
materials can build up around the vent in a steep, cone-shaped hill or small
mountain that is called a **cinder cone**. For example, Paricutin in Mexico erupted
in 1943 in a farmer's cornfield. The volcano built up a cinder cone that was
about 400 meters high.

  <figure>
    <img src="fig12.png" alt="Figure 12"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 12. Cinder Cone Volcanoes.</figcaption>
  </figure>

### Composite Volcanoe
Sometimes, the silica content of magma can vary. So eruptions of lava -flows
alternate with explosive eruptions of ash, cinder, and bombs. The result is a
composite volcano. **Composite volcanoes** are tall, cone-shaped mountains in which
layers of lava alternate with layers of ash. Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount St.
Helens in Washington State are composite volcanoes. Composite volcanoes can be
more than 4,800 meters tall.

  <figure>
    <img src="fig13.png" alt="Figure 13"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 13. Composite Volcanoes.</figcaption>
  </figure>

### Shield Volcanoes

At some spots on Earth's surface, thin layers of lava pour out of a vent and
harden on top of previous layers. Such lava flows slowly build a wide, gently
sloping mountain called a shield volcano. Hot spot volcanoes that form on the
ocean floor are usually shield volcanoes. For example, in Hawaii, Mauna Loa
rises 9,000 meters from the ocean floor.

  <figure>
    <img src="fig14.png" alt="Figure 14"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 14. Shield Volcanoes.</figcaption>
  </figure>

### Lava Plateaus

Lava can flow out of several long cracks in an area. The thin, runny lava floods
the area and travels far before cooling and solidifying. After millions of
years, repeated floods of lava can form high, level plateaus. These plateaus are
called lava plateaus. The Columbia Plateau is a lava plateau that covers parts
of Washington State, Oregon, and Idaho.

  <figure>
    <img src="fig15.png" alt="Figure 15"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 15. Lava Plateaus.</figcaption>
  </figure>


### What Landforms Does Magma Create?

Sometimes magma cools and hardens into rock before reaching the surface. Over
time, forces such as flowing water, ice, or wind may strip away the layers above
the hardened magma and expose it. **Features formed by magma include volcanic
necks, dikes, and sills, as well as dome mountains and batholiths.**

### Volcanic Necks 

Look at Figure 17. The landform that looks like a giant tooth stuck in the
ground is Shiprock in New Mexico. Shiprock formed when magma hardened in an
ancient volcano's pipe. Later, the softer rock around the pipe wore away,
exposing the harder rock inside. A **volcanic neck** forms when magma hardens in a
volcano's pipe and the surrounding rock later wears away.


  <figure>
    <img src="fig17.png" alt="Figure 17"/>
    <figcaption>Figure 17. Vocanic Necks, Dikes, and Sills.</figcaption>
  </figure>

### Dikes and Sills 

Magma that forces itself across rock layers hardens into a **dike**. Magma that
squeezes between horizontal rock layers hardens to form a **sill**.


### Dome Mountains 

Bodies of hardened magma can create dome mountains. A dome mountain forms when
uplift pushes a large body of hardened magma toward the surface. The hardenec
magma forces the layers of rock to bend upward into a dome shape. Eventually,
the rock above the dome mountain wears away, leaving it exposed. This process
formed the Black Hills in South Dakota.

### Batholiths 

How large can landforms created by magma be? Look at the map in Figure 18. A
**batholith** is a mass of rock formed when a large body of magma cools inside
the crust. Batholiths form the core of many mountain ranges. Over millions of
years, the overlying rock wears away, allowing the batholith to move upward.
Flowing water and grinding ice slowly carve the batholith into mountains.

23. A geologist observes the area and a large volcano, see Figure 23. She decides that this
volcano must once have had an explosive erotion. What evidence might have led
her to this conclussion? Discuss the type of magma produces an explosive
eruption and the rocks that would result from an explosive eruption.
